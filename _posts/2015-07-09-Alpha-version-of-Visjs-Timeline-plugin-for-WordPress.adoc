= Alpha version of Vis.js Timeline plugin for WordPress

I created this tiny timeline plugin a while ago, using vis.js timeline, which is a pretty amazing JavaScript library with extensive timeline features including pinch-to-zoom and full touch support.

I'm finally releasing this as an alpha now, available here:
https://github.com/Ugotsta/visjs-timelines-wordpress-plugin

It's currently very simple, just include the shortcode in your content: [vis-timeline]

There are some additional arguments available too, but I'll just mention the 'args' argument that lets you provide a custom WP query like so: [vis-timeline args="post_type=products"]

I'll try and get a more detailed post up for it at my main blog, but just wanted to quickly mention it here.
