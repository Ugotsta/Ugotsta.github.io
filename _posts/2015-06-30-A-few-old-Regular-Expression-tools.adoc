= A few, old Regular Expression tools

I've had these lingering for ages now, a regex search and regex replace tool done using jQuery, as follows:

Regex search: http://ugotsta.github.io/tools/regex_search.html

Regex replace: http://ugotsta.github.io/tools/regex_replace.html

They're not at all recommended for real world use but simply as a helpful tool for those who would like a somewhat simple example of how a regex tool can be made using HTML and jQuery.

I'd otherwise have to recommend the far superior https://regex101.com/
