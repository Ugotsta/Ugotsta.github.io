= Simple Music Visualizer inspired by Monstercat

So here's a revised version of my basic music visualizer:
http://ugotsta.github.io/projects/p5-ambience?url=https://soundcloud.com/ugotsta/dreaming-of-dreams

You can replace the url at the end with any SoundCloud url to visualize any audio from SoundCloud.

Meanwhile, here's all the code composing it:
https://github.com/Ugotsta/Ugotsta.github.io/blob/master/projects/p5-ambience.html

Pure HTML and JavaScript relying on the excellent P5.js library.

Oh and I released this video, it composites 2 videos, one recorded from APEXvj, the other from this visualizer.
