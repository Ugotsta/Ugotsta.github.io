Really simple, this form just takes sentences and paragraphs and converts them to a format that can be used with asciinema: https://asciinema.org/

The purpose is simply to use asciinema to produce a typewriter effect of any given text. Just enter that text in the text area, press the button and it converts it to asciinema save format so you can copy-paste it in a file and play it.
