= Work-in-progress bash script to install Future Pinball on Ubuntu

I've been toiling at this bash script to simplify the process of installing and playing Future Pinball on Ubuntu, via WINE. Currently, it's a bit complicated to install, given that Future Pinball is designed solely for Windows. :)

Fortunately, some helpful guys have helped make it possible for others to get it up and running on Linux. I'm just hoping to make the process a little easier.

Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/Ugotsta/fa9551aa799218a2f508
