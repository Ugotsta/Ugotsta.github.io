= AutoIt3 script to seamlessly loop videos

This is sort of a followup to my post about Winamp visualization recording. This companion script can take those recorded videos and loop them seamlessly.

Here's the gist:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ugotsta/3496a2706e71dd46e538.js"></script>

Basically, the script just makes 2 copies of the video file, and merges them at midpoint with a transition.

As noted in the gist, MLT is required, it's totally free. And better yet, you can easily install Shotcut and it'll use the MLT file included with that.
