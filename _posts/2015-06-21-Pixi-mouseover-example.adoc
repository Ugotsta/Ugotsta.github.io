= Pixi mouseover example


I recently starting playing around with pixi.js but had a tough time finding certain types of code examples. After some searching, I figured I should throw together some examples as I go, so here's the first. It's an example of a simple mouseover effect. A circle starts with a 0.5 alpha value and when hovering over it with the mouse, it changes to alpha value of 1.

Simple eh?

Here's the code:

And here's a CodePen version as well so you can easily see and interact with it live:
