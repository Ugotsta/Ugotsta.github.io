= Very basic music visualization template

After the previous release of my "Hidden in Darkness" music visualization using p5.js, I realized it just doesn't look at all good in a YouTube video given the size of the elements. So I've started with a more basic template mimicing Monstercat's styling completely, to start with.

Here's the result: http://ugotsta.github.io/projects/p5-music-template-basic.html

I also realized a great way to make this more accessible is to accept a url parameter so you can add ?url= then the url of any soundcloud track and it'll visualize that track.

This is totally basic at the moment, dead simple with just a spectrum analyzer, no background graphics. But it's got the more important bits and effects can easily be added.
