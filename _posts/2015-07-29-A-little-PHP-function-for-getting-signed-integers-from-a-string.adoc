= A little PHP function for getting signed integers from a string

I've been working on an update to my Impress for WordPres plugin and needed a way to accept signed integers as values added after particular effect strings such as "rotate-45", "scale+2" or "slide-up-500".

So here's the function I created for it:

Hope someone finds it helpful, I certainly have since there are multiple other projects I can use this for.
