= Binary matrix effect in blue

Continuing with my matrix experiments, this one's a bunch of 0's and 1's moving horizontally across the screen. Again done using pixi.js.

Full-screen example: http://ugotsta.github.io/projects/pixi-0101-blue.html

For the full-screen effect, use Google Chrome and press F11 for full-screen, then F5 to refresh.

Here's the file in my repo: https://github.com/Ugotsta/Ugotsta.github.io/blob/master/projects/pixi-0101-blue.html
